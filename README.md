# Weather-Dashboard-API

The Weather Dashboard is a simple and user-friendly web application that enables users to search for any city and instantly view its current weather conditions along with a multi-day forecast. It retrieves real-time weather data—including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions like sunny, cloudy, or rainy—using a free weather API. To enhance usability, the application features a Dark/Light mode toggle, allowing users to switch themes based on their visual preference or environment.
